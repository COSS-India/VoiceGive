# Bhashadaan Project Setup Guide

## Project Overview

Bhashadaan is a Flutter-based UI application designed for language data collection and crowdsourcing initiatives. This project provides a complete, customizable user interface that can be adopted by organizations, government agencies, and developers to build their own language data collection applications with features like voice recording, text validation, and multi-language support.

The UI is built on a Swagger API specification, making it adaptable for different implementations. Adopters can:

- **Reference the API Documentation**: Use the provided Swagger specification to understand the complete API structure and endpoints
- **Build Custom APIs**: Implement their own backend services based on the API specification
- **Integrate with Existing UI**: Use this Flutter UI as a ready-made frontend that works with the API specification
- **Customize for Different Use Cases**: Adapt the UI components and API integration to meet specific organizational needs

flutter doctor
```

Ensure all checks pass, especially:
- ✅ Flutter (Channel stable, 3.6.0 or higher)
- ✅ Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
- ✅ Android Studio (version 2022.1 or higher)
- ✅ VS Code (optional but recommended)

### 3. Check Flutter Version

```bash
flutter --version
```

Expected output should show Flutter 3.6.0 or higher.

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Create Environment Files

The project supports multiple environments. Create the following files in the root directory:

#### For Development
```bash
# Create .env.development file
touch .env.development
```

Add the following content to `.env.development`:
```env
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://example.com
API_ORIGIN_URL=https://example.com
API_REFERER_URL=https://example.com/
```

#### For Staging
```bash
# Create .env.staging file
touch .env.staging
```

Add the following content to `.env.staging`:
```env
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com
API_ORIGIN_URL=https://staging.example.com
API_REFERER_URL=https://staging.example.com/
```

#### For Production
```bash
# Create .env.production file
touch .env.production
```

Add the following content to `.env.production`:
```env
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://production.example.com
API_ORIGIN_URL=https://production.example.com
API_REFERER_URL=https://production.example.com/
```

### 2. Verify Environment Configuration

Check that your environment files are properly configured by examining the app configuration:

```bash
# Check if environment files exist
ls -la | grep .env
```

Expected output should show:
- `.env.development`
- `.env.staging` 
- `.env.production`

### 3. Environment Variable Requirements

Ensure each environment file contains the following required variables that match `lib/config/app_config.dart`:

- `API_BASE_URL` - The base URL for API endpoints
- `API_ORIGIN_URL` - The origin URL for CORS headers
- `API_REFERER_URL` - The referer URL for CORS headers  

**Note**: Replace the placeholder bearer tokens with actual values for each environment.

## Dependencies Installation

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Verify Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub deps
```

### 3. Check for Dependency Issues

```bash
flutter pub outdated
```

### 4. Clean and Rebuild (if needed)

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## Android Setup

### 1. Configure Android SDK

Ensure your Android SDK is properly configured:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Accept all licenses when prompted.

### 2. Set Up Android Emulator

```

### 3. Connect Physical Device (Alternative)

1. Enable **Developer Options** on your Android device
2. Enable **USB Debugging**
3. Connect device via USB
4. Verify connection:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

### 4. Verify Android Configuration

```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

Ensure Android toolchain shows:
- ✅ Android SDK at [your-sdk-path]
- ✅ Android NDK location not configured
- ✅ Platform android-33, build-tools 33.0.0
- ✅ Java binary at [java-path]

## Running the Application

# Solution: Update Flutter
flutter upgrade
```

#### 2. Build Issues

**Issue**: Gradle build failed
```bash
# Solution: Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Issue**: Android SDK not found
```bash
# Solution: Set ANDROID_HOME
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

#### 3. Dependency Issues

**Issue**: Package not found
```bash
# Solution: Update dependencies
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
```

**Issue**: Version conflict
